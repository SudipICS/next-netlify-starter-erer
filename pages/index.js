                                        period for settlement as a partner or spouse. You might also need to extend if
                                        you don’t fully meet the requirements for settlement after 5 years, for example,
                                        if you cannot yet speak English to the required level for settlement or if you

                                        need to pass an approved English language test at least a CEFR level A1 in
                                        speaking and listening, which is beginner’s level. For your extension after 2.5
                                        years, you must prove that you pass an approved English language test at least a
                                        CEFR level A2 l, which could be considered as elementary level and is slightly
                                        more difficult than A1. For settlement, you must demonstrate that you can speak
                                        English at B1 level, which is intermediate level.</span></p>

                                        for 33 months (Entry Clearance) or 30 Months if the application is made inside
                                        the UK. You can extend your visa and you would normally be able to apply for
                                        settlement no more than 28 days before completing 60 months on your spouse visa.
                                        If you apply successfully to settle in the UK, you would be free from
                                        immigration restrictions – that means that there would be no time limit on your

                                <p><span style="color: #414141;">An application made from outside the UK could take

                                        countries, for expedited processing. On approval, your passport would be
                                        endorsed with a “vignette” to allow you to travel to the UK. You would need to

                                                requirements?</b></span></span></h2>
                                <p><span style="color: #414141;">In order to make a successful application as a partner
                                        or spouse, the couple must provide specified evidence to show that they have
                                        sufficient income or means to support themselves in the UK. This requirement
                                        applies if the partner is joining the UK sponsor from overseas, if the couple
                                        are already living together in the UK or if the couple are returning to the UK,
                                        from overseas. Evidence required depends on the couple’s individual
                                        circumstances, but generally speaking the financial requirement for a partner
                                        visa is £18,600. So, for example, if the sponsor has been in permanent paid
                                        employment for more than 6 months, earning a fixed salary of over £18,600 per
                                        annum, the couple could use evidence of the sponsor’s income to meet the
                                        financial requirement.</span></p>
                                <p><span style="color: #414141;">Evidence of savings can also be used or combined with
                                        employment income evidence to meet the financial requirement. Extensive
                                        additional evidence would be required for self-employed individuals who are
                                        relying on their self-employed income to meet the financial requirement.</span>

                                <p><span style="color: #414141;">If the couple have children who would be sponsored as
                                        dependents of the main applicant partner, the financial threshold is increased
                                        for each child included in the application. Specifically, in addition to the
                                        £18,600 threshold for the partner, an additional £3,800 is required for the
                                        first child and a further £2,400 for each additional child.</span></p>

                                <p><span style="color: #414141;">The cost of a spouse/partner visa made inside the UK is
                                        £1033. The applicant will also need to pay £19.20 biometric enrolment fee as
                                        part of the application.</span></p>
                                <p><span style="color: #414141;">From outside the UK the spouse visa (classified as a

                                        The settlement priority service, if available in the country of application
                                        would be an additional £573.</span></p>
                                <p><span style="color: #414141;">The applicant must also pay the Immigration Health
                                        Surcharge, which is £624 per year (£312 for every 6 month period). The spouse
                                        visa is granted for a 30 months (2.5 years) inside the UK, therefore the total
                                        surcharge would be £1560 for leave to remain. From outside the UK, the visa is
                                        granted for 33 months, therefore the total surcharge would be £1,872.</span></p>

                                <p><span style="color: #414141;">You normally need to show that you have adequate

                                        family unit). This means that the space you occupy must not be overcrowded and
                                        is affordable to you. You can own or rent the property. You may even be staying
                                        somewhere rent-free, for example with family members.</span></p>
                                <p><span style="color: #414141;">In every case, you will still need to submit evidence

                                        within 10 days of arrival to the UK from a Post Office you would have selected
                                        during the application process.</span></p>
                                <p><span style="color: #414141;">During the period of your visa, you will be able to
                                        live and work in the United Kingdom. You will not be able to access public funds
                                        whilst on a spouse visa but you will have access to the NHS, as you will have
                                        paid the Immigration Health Surcharge as part of your visa application. Although
                                        you are permitted to travel overseas, you will need to reside with your partner
                                        in the UK continuously to qualify for an extension of leave/ILR after 60 months.
                                        You should keep evidence of living together from the date your visa is granted,
                                        for example bills, bank statements and other official letters and correspondence
                                        addressed to you and your partner at your shared home.</span></p>

                                        you will be issued with a letter confirming the decision. If the application is
                                        refused, the letter would also confirm if you have the right of appeal.
                                        Depending on the grounds for refusal you may consider re-applying or challenging
                                        the decision if you believe the decision is wrong or unfair.</span></p>
                                <p><span style="color: #414141;">Time limits may apply for challenging a decision so you
                                        should contact a lawyer as soon as possible. If you are already in the UK, your
                                        current status may also be affected by the negative decision, so you it is
                                        advisable to seek legal advice to check how your status and future applications
                                        may be affected.</span></p>
